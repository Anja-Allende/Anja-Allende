"14) Do not follow where the path may lead.  Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. <div class='quote-author'> Ralph Waldo Emerson</div>",
"15) One’s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things. <div class='quote-author'> Henry Miller</div>",

"41) The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one’s own country as a foreign land. <div class='quote-author'> G.K. Chesterton</div>",
"42) He who does not travel does not know the value of men. <div class='quote-author'> Moorish Proverb</div>",
"43) The woman who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. The woman who walks alone is likely to find herself in places no one has ever been before. <div class='quote-author'> Albert Einstein</div>",
