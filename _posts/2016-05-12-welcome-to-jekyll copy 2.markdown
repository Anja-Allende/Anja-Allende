I thought I must be dreaming that
I thought I was awake,
For I was without question in
A most peculiar state.

Who was thinking I was dreaming
I was thinking in my sleep?
Was I awake while sleeping?
Oh, this was far too deep!

Or was I dreaming I was thinking
I was dreaming in the night?
And would I wake up tired or rested
Come the morning light?

The alarm beeped, and quickly I
Rolled off the rumpled bed,
Grateful for the clarity
That lit the day ahead.
